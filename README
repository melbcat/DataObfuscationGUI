
Hi there! This project is just an Android GUI to test data obfuscation algorithms.

INSTALLATION IN AN ANDROID EMULATOR
There is no GPS device in the emulator, so please, if you want to use this Android app in an Android emulator, do the following actions:
* comment line 276 to 278 of LocationObfuscationActivity.java
* uncomment line 279 of LocationObfuscationActivity.java. This will generate a default GPS location.
